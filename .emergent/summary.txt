The previous AI engineer successfully launched the BlueCheck Inspections P/L website, handling all initial requirements from mock data to a fully functional, lead-generating application. This involved building a React frontend with comprehensive UI/UX, a FastAPI backend for inquiry management with MongoDB, and integrating Gmail SMTP for email notifications. Crucially, Google Ads tracking was implemented for key conversion events. The codebase is well-structured, utilizing Shadcn UI components and adhering to environment variable best practices. The transition phase commenced with a significant rebranding request to Safe Building Inspections, including new logos and various content updates. The AI engineer is currently converting the new logos to base64 and preparing to integrate these extensive rebranding changes, having deferred the SMTP update as per user instruction.
